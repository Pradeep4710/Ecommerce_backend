Here's the **README** for the **backend** of your eCommerce website **Shopee Globe**:

---

# **Shopee Globe - Backend**

The **Shopee Globe Backend** powers the eCommerce website by managing products, users, and orders. It is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle API requests, data storage, and authentication. The backend communicates with a **MongoDB** database to store and retrieve product information, user details, and order data.

## **Features**
- **Product Management:** API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete products.
- **User Authentication:** JWT-based authentication system for user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Cart Management:** API to manage user cart data.
- **Order Processing:** Handles the creation and management of orders placed by users.
- **Admin Features:** Admin access to manage products, users, and view orders.
- **Data Validation:** Validates user inputs using **Joi** or similar libraries to ensure data integrity.
- **CORS Support:** Enables the frontend to communicate with the backend by handling CORS requests.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose ORM for data modeling)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- **Middleware:** Express middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation
- **Environment Variables:** **dotenv** for environment configuration (e.g., database URL, JWT secret key)
- **Data Validation:** **Joi** or similar libraries for validating user input
- **CORS:** Configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend

## **Folder Structure**
```
/src
  /controllers       - Contains functions for handling API requests (e.g., product, user, order)

  /routes            - Defines API routes for handling requests (e.g., product routes, user routes)
  /middleware        - Custom middleware for authentication, logging, error handling
  /config            - Configuration files (e.g., environment variables, database connection)
  /utils             - Utility functions (e.g., for hashing passwords, generating JWTs)
  server.js          - Entry point of the backend application
  .env               - Environment configuration (database URL, JWT secret)
```
